# SOSA Governor — On-Demand Audit & Reporting

This skill provides manual governance operations. The hooks handle real-time
classification and gating automatically; this skill handles reporting,
configuration, and manual overrides.

## Audit Report

When the user asks for a SOSA audit or governance report:

1. Read the audit log at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/audit/` for today's date (YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl)
2. Parse each line as JSON — fields: timestamp, session_id, tool, impact_level, reason, decision
3. Summarize:
   - Total tool calls today
   - Breakdown by impact level (low / medium / high)
   - Denied actions (high-impact that were blocked)
   - Most active tools
   - Sessions with the most activity
4. Present as a clear table

## Trust Score Management

When the user asks about trust scores or wants to reset trust:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/trust-state.json`
2. The `tools` object maps tool names to trust scores (0.0 = no trust, 1.0+ = auto-approved)
3. Display current trust scores for all tools that have scores
4. To reset a tool's trust: update the JSON, setting the tool's score back to 0

Trust formula:
- Each successful approval: +0.1
- Each incident: -0.5
- Threshold for auto-approval: 1.0 (requires ~10 successful approvals)

## Impact Registry

When the user asks which tools are classified at what level:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/impact-registry.json`
2. Display the three tiers (high, medium, low) with tools and reasons
3. The user can request reclassification — edit the registry JSON accordingly
4. Default level for unregistered MCP tools: medium

## Token Budget Status

When the user asks about token budgets:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/budgets.json`
2. Show the budget hierarchy: monthly → weekly → daily → per-category
3. Compare against today's audit log to estimate actual usage
4. Flag categories approaching their daily limit (>80%)

## Compliance Check

When the user asks to check SOSA compliance:

Evaluate the current setup against SOSA levels:

**Level 1 — Basic:**
- [ ] Impact registry exists and has entries
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in skill files
- [ ] Pinned dependencies

**Level 2 — Standard:**
- [ ] Level 1 + audit logging active (check for today's audit file)
- [ ] Token budget config exists
- [ ] Trust gradient configured

**Level 3 — Full:**
- [ ] Level 2 + PreToolUse hooks active (high-impact gating)
- [ ] Plan → Act → Verify → Optimize loop documented
- [ ] Trust gradient with persistence
- [ ] Cross-session audit capability

Report which level is currently achieved and what's missing for the next level.

## Security Scan

When the user asks for a security check:

1. Use Grep to scan all SKILL.md files for patterns matching API keys, tokens, passwords:
   - Patterns: `sk-`, `api_key`, `token.*=.*[A-Za-z0-9]{20}`, `password`, `secret`
2. Check if any MCP configs have hardcoded credentials (vs environment variables)
3. Review recent audit logs for unusual patterns:
   - Same tool denied then immediately approved (potential social engineering)
   - Burst of high-impact actions in short timeframe
   - Tools called from sessions that don't normally use them
4. Report findings with severity ratings

## Modifying the Registry

When the user wants to change an impact classification:

1. Read the current registry
2. Move the tool entry between the high/medium/low arrays
3. Write the updated registry back
4. Confirm the change and note that it takes effect immediately (next tool call)
